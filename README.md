📖 Overview

The Smart Attendance System is a computer-vision–based attendance solution designed to automatically record student attendance using face detection and recognition at controlled entry points.

The system is built as a real-world pilot project, focusing on:

reliability over hype

local (on-premise) processing

privacy-first design

gradual scalability

It is not a toy project — it is designed for actual deployment in a school environment.

🎯 Project Goals

Automate attendance at school entry points

Reduce manual effort for teachers

Avoid proxy attendance

Work under real-world conditions:

partial faces

angled faces

movement

lighting variations

Require no cloud GPU or recurring cost
